Hi, welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student in Economics at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en). My main interests are in trade, spatial economics and innovation. 

Here is my [CV](CV_Pauly.pdf).

### Papers

- **The Diffusion of Knowledge: Evidence from the Jet Age**, with [Fernando Stipanicic](https://fernandostipanicic.github.io/)

This paper studies the impact of travel time on the diffusion and creation of knowledge. We provide causal evidence by exploiting the beginning of the Jet Age as a natural experiment. We digitize airlines' historical flight schedules and construct a novel data set of the flight network in the United States. Between 1951 and 1966, travel time between locations more than 2,000km apart decreased on average 41%. We use patent data as a measure of knowledge creation and diffusion. For research establishments located more than 2,000km apart, the reduction in travel time increased citations by 7.6%, accounting for 36.1% of the observed increase in citations in this distance interval. The decrease in travel time also led to an increase in knowledge access of each location which spurred the creation of new patents. The effect was stronger in initially less innovative locations, leading to a yearly growth rate of patenting 1.2 percentage points higher relative to more innovative locations. The predicted difference accounts for 23.5% of the convergence rate observed. We uncover one mechanism through which convergence occurred: expansion of multi-establishment firms. We find that the reduction in travel time to a firm's headquarters led to an increase in the amount of subsidiaries in other locations, with a larger relative increase of subsidiaries in initially less innovative locations.

- **Creation and Diffusion of Knowledge in the Global Firm**, with [Cagatay Bircan](http://cagataybircan.com/) and [Beata Javorcik](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0247/)

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    This study documents new stylized facts on where and how knowledge creation and
diffusion take place in multinational firms and shows that differences in time zones
between headquarters and subsidiaries matter for knowledge flows beyond the effects
of distance. The data show that (i) knowledge creation, as measured by patents, is
increasingly conducted in cross-border collaborative teams of inventors within multinationals, (ii) a large share of patenting activity takes place in foreign affiliates, and
(iii) inventors have become more mobile over the last three decades. An econometric analysis shows that a higher overlap in business hours is associated with increased
cross-border collaboration, more within-firm citations, and greater inventor mobility.
