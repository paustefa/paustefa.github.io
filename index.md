Hi, welcome to my website! 

I work as an economist at the [ILO](https://www.ilo.org/global/lang--en/index.htm). I obtained my PhD in Economics in 2023 from [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en) under the supervision of [Thomas Chaney](https://sites.google.com/site/thomaschaney/home?authuser=0). My main interests are in trade, spatial economics, development and innovation. 

Here are my [CV](CV_Pauly.pdf) and my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AG-9fPYAAAAJ&hl=fr).

### Papers

- [**The Diffusion of Knowledge: Evidence from the Jet Age**](https://fernandostipanicic.github.io/files/jmp.pdf), with [Fernando Stipanicic](https://fernandostipanicic.github.io/)\
	_Best paper award at [RIEF](https://sites.google.com/site/riefnetwork) Paris meeting 2021._\
	_Best paper award at [3rd Workshop in Entrepreneurial Finance and Innovation](https://www.workshop-efi.com/student-workshop)._

This paper provides new causal evidence of the impact of air travel time on the
creation and diffusion of knowledge. We exploit the beginning of the Jet Age as
a quasi-natural experiment. We digitize airlines’ historical flight schedules and
construct a novel data set of the flight network in the United States. Between
1951 and 1966, travel time between locations more than 2,000 km apart decreased
on average by 41%. The reduction in travel time explains 33% of the increase in
knowledge diffusion as measured by patent citations. The increase in knowledge
diffusion further caused an increase in the creation of new knowledge. The results
provide evidence that jet airplanes led to innovation convergence across locations
and contributed to the shift in innovation activity towards the South and the West
of the United States.    </p>

- [**Time after Time: Communication Costs and Inventor Collaboration in the Multinational Firm**](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0247/Telecom.pdf), with [Cagatay Bircan](http://cagataybircan.com/) and [Beata Javorcik](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0247/)

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
We show that knowledge creation, as measured by patents, is increasingly conducted in
cross-border collaborative teams of inventors. We document the importance of cross-
border communication costs by showing that a higher overlap in business hours is
associated with increased cross-border collaboration. This effect is distinct from the
effect of physical distance, which matters as well. It is stronger for technology classes
where lab experiments are involved and thus more frequent interactions may be required. 
Episodes of telecommunications liberalization (and the resulting decline in the
cost of international calls) lead to an increase in cross-border collaboration, particularly 
when the business hour overlap between the headquarters and a subsidiary is
larger. This effect is stronger for experiment-based technology classes. Less successful
inventors respond more than their most successful peers.

    <p align="justify">
Tourism in cities creates social interactions among people from distant cultures within limited space. How does the influx of tourists affect locals’ satisfaction with amenities? Using data on restaurant reviews, we construct a panel of tourist presence in Paris. Based on two unanticipated drops in tourism – the November 2015 terrorist attack and the COVID-19 pandemic – we document that tourism reduces Parisians’ satisfaction with restaurants. We find that social frictions, like xenophobia towards tourists, drive our results. As tourist numbers declined, explicit complaints about tourists in reviews decreased, while other complaints remained unaffected. Locals are least satisfied with dining among tourists from countries with weak social ties to France. Tourists are not affected by the presence of other tourists.

- **Traders in Trouble on the Road to Mandalay**\
	_Draft available upon request._
	
    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
This paper studies the effect of uncertainty in trade costs on exporting. A large share of Myanmar's 
exports leaves to neighbouring countries via roads crossing heavily contested territory. 
Combining data on armed conflict with trade transaction data, I show that armed conflict close to
these roads has a significant impact on trade flows. Firm-level export transactions via an affected route
drop by around 50%. In addition, prices for export goods in Yangon’s retail markets, itself far away from conflict areas, drop by around 5%. 
This pass-through to local prices suggests that, as exporting via a conflict-affected route becomes risky, 
traders have few export alternatives and sell domestically instead. In addition, I observe that exporters
of non-perishable goods delay transactions, reducing the negative impact of conflict.
Among exporters of perishable and thus riskier products, large and politically connected firms
are the most resilient. Overall, this suggests that the risk of losing shipments induced by conflict reduces exports, skews the distribution of gains from trade towards specific firms and spills over to the domestic market.
