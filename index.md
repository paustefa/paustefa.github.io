## About Me

[comment]: <>  (<img class="profile-picture" src="logo.jpg">)

Hi, welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student in Economics at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en). My main interests are in trade, spatial economics and innovation. 

Here is my [CV](CV_Pauly.pdf).

## Research

### Research Papers

1. "**Aggregate Uncertainty and the Micro-Dynamics of Firms.**" (2020). [Click here](Paper_Dynamics.pdf) [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3591987)]

    <p align="justify">
Using firm level micro-data, I find evidence that firms with lower growth prospects are more sensitive to aggregate shocks. I interpret these findings using a model of demand accumulation and endogenous entry and exit decisions, which I then estimate on French data. The resulting cyclical dynamics of firms provide an explanation for the observed counter-cyclical dispersion in firms' growth rates. They suggest that cyclical dispersion is the result of a pre-existing and persistent characteristic of the firm and caution against its use as a proxy for time-varying uncertainty. The estimated negative correlation between a firm's sensitivity to aggregate shocks and its expected future growth rate is shown to have important consequences for the cyclical characteristics of entering and exiting firms. The quantitative model suggests that this compositional effect is sizeable and equivalent to around 10.5% of the drop in aggregate employment between 2008 and 2009.

2. "**Intra-Firm Hierarchies and Gender Gaps**" (2020), with [Aseem Patel](https://sites.google.com/view/aseempatel/home) and [Joanne Tan](https://sites.google.com/site/joanneyumintanphd/research) - [Click here](Gender_Paper.pdf) [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3701189)]. *R&R Labour Economics*

    We study how changes in female representation at the top of a firm’s organisation
    affect gender-specific outcomes across hierarchies within firms. We start by developing
    a theoretical model of a hierarchical firms, where gender representation in top
    organisational layers can affect gender-specific hiring and promotion probabilities at
    lower layers. We then exploit a recent French reform that imposed gender representation
    quotas in the boards of directors and test the model’s predictions in the data.
    Our empirical results show that the reform was successful in reducing gender wage
    and representation gaps at the upper layers of the firm, but not at lower firm layers.
    A Panel VAR analysis confirms that the trickle-down effect of this policy was limited
    and suggests that interventions targeting the managerial layer, rather than the board,
    might have a more generalised effect across the firm.

3. "**Income Tax Progressivity as a Stabilizer of Labor Income Risk**" (2020), with [Julien Pascal](https://julienpascal.github.io/) - [Click here](Paper_Taxation.pdf).

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    In this article we use Italian administrative data to study the role that a progressive
    income tax can play in redistributing cyclical risk from low to high wage workers and
    reduce the volatility of aggregate employment. We do this by developing and estimating a frictional model of the labor market with heterogeneous workers, aggregate
    shocks and a non-linear tax schedule. Our results show that eliminating income tax
    progressivity in Italy while maintaining the tax revenue fixed would come at the expense of the majority of workers. The current system of marginal tax rates is effective
    at reallocating cyclical income risk from low to high wage workers and reduces aggregate employment volatility by 18.5% compared to a counter-factual flat rate system.

4. "**Friendship Networks and Political Opinions: A Natural Experiment among Future French Politicians**" (2020), with [Yann Algan](http://www.yann-algan.com/), [Quoc-Anh Do](https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/), and [Yves Zenou](https://sites.google.com/site/yvesbzenou/). [Click here](Network_Beliefs_2020.pdf) [[SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3397092)].

    <p align="justify">
    This paper shows how friendship shapes beliefs and political opinion. We make use of a unique
    natural experiment that randomly assigns new freshmen into groups in a college that produces most
    of France’s top politicians. We find strong, robust effects of friendship on differences in beliefs.
