Hi, welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student in Economics at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en). My main interests are in trade, spatial economics and innovation. 

Here is my [CV](CV_Pauly.pdf).

## Research

### Papers

- [**The Diffusion of Knowledge: Evidence from the Jet Age**](https://fernandostipanicic.github.io/files/jmp.pdf), with [Fernando Stipanicic](https://fernandostipanicic.github.io/)
	_Best paper award at [RIEF](https://sites.google.com/site/riefnetwork) Paris meeting 2021._

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
This paper provides new causal evidence of the impact of air travel time on the
creation and diffusion of knowledge. We exploit the beginning of the Jet Age as
a quasi-natural experiment. We digitize airlines’ historical flight schedules and
construct a novel data set of the flight network in the United States. Between
1951 and 1966, travel time between locations more than 2,000 km apart decreased
on average by 41%. The reduction in travel time explains 33% of the increase in
knowledge diffusion as measured by patent citations. The increase in knowledge
diffusion further caused an increase in the creation of new knowledge. The results
provide evidence that jet airplanes led to innovation convergence across locations
and contributed to the shift in innovation activity towards the South and the West
of the United States.    </p>

- **Creation and Diffusion of Knowledge in the Global Firm**, with [Cagatay Bircan](http://cagataybircan.com/) and [Beata Javorcik](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0247/)

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    This study documents new stylized facts on where and how knowledge creation and
diffusion take place in multinational firms and shows that differences in time zones
between headquarters and subsidiaries matter for knowledge flows beyond the effects
of distance. The data show that (i) knowledge creation, as measured by patents, is
increasingly conducted in cross-border collaborative teams of inventors within multinationals, (ii) a large share of patenting activity takes place in foreign affiliates, and
(iii) inventors have become more mobile over the last three decades. An econometric analysis shows that a higher overlap in business hours is associated with increased
cross-border collaboration, more within-firm citations, and greater inventor mobility.
