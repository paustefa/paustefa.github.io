Hi, welcome to my website! 

I am a PhD student in Economics at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en). My main interests are in trade, spatial economics and innovation. 

Here is my [CV](CV_Pauly.pdf).

## Research

### Papers

- **The diffusion of knowledge: Evidence from the Jet Age**, with [Fernando Stipanicic](https://fernandostipanicic.github.io/)

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
This paper studies the impact of travel time on the diffusion of knowledge. We provide causal evidence by exploiting the beginning of the
Jet Age as a quasi-natural experiment. We digitize airlines’ historical
flight schedules and construct a novel data set of the flight network in
the United States. Between 1951 and 1966, average travel time between
locations more than 2,000km apart decreased 35%. We use patent citations as a measure of knowledge diffusion. For research establishments
located more than 2,000km apart from each other, the reduction in
travel time increased citations by 8.1%, accounting for 38% of the observed increase in citations in this distance interval. Additionally, the
reduction in travel time increased the diffusion of knowledge through
multi-establishment firms. The probability of a firm having a satellite research establishment increased by 300% as consequence of the
reduction in travel time. At the same time, a research establishment
of a firm is 13% more likely to cite a patent from a location in which
the firm has another research establishment, compared to a location in
which it does not have it.

- **Creation and Diffusion of Knowledge in the Multinational Firm**, with [Cagatay Bircan](http://cagataybircan.com/) and [Beata Javorcik](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0247/)

    <details><summary> <i>Abstract</i> </summary>
    <p align="justify">
    This study documents new stylized facts on where and how knowledge creation and
diffusion take place in multinational firms and shows that differences in time zones
between headquarters and subsidiaries matter for knowledge flows beyond the effects
of distance. The data show that (i) knowledge creation, as measured by patents, is
increasingly conducted in cross-border collaborative teams of inventors within multi-
nationals, (ii) a large share of patenting activity takes place in foreign affiliates, and
(iii) inventors have become more mobile over the last three decades. An economet-
ric analysis shows that a higher overlap in business hours is associated with increased
cross-border collaboration, more within-firm citations, and greater inventor mobility.
